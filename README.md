# [ActiveCV](https://github.com/Knightler/activecv/)
ActiveCV is a self-driving active learning pipeline for computer vision: it trains a model on your labeled images, finds the unlabeled images it’s most unsure about, sends them to a labeling queue (human or optional auto-labeler), then retrains and repeats—so you reach high accuracy with far fewer labels.
